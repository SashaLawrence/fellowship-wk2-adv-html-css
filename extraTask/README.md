# Week Two: Advanced

Feel free to try either of these tasks to test/advance what you have learnt

### Task 1

Here are some more designs to make into code. Make each page with HTML & Sass.

Consider reusable components for each page.

Split up your Sass files into a sensible system (e.g one for rest, settings, typography and for each component etc...)

### Task 2

[Bees and Bombs](https://twitter.com/beesandbombs) is a renowned developer who creates animation gifs.

Look at this [search on Codepen](https://codepen.io/search/pens/?q=bees%20and%20bombs). Front End Developers like replicating the gifs in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try to find an example that uses Sass to create the animation.

Create an animation of your own using advanced Sass features.
