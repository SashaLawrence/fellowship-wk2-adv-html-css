# Brief/Project

---

Fill out the details

- Who are your users?
- What are they trying to do?
- What are the business aims
- What technologies are we going to use? Do they need to be able to support it in-house?
- What other systems does it need to work with?

---

# Personas & User Journeys

---

### Different people are different

- Different people
- will use your site differently
- and for different purposes

---

### You should

- Try to understand who they are
- Plan for their needs
- Test for their typical behaviours

---

# Exercise:

[http://apprenticeshiphubwest.co.uk/](http://apprenticeshiphubwest.co.uk/)

---

### Answer

- What is this site for?
- Who are our users (name three)?
- What will they do?
- What technologies will they use?

---

### Let's go over it

---

# This weeks brief

---

### Business background

I‚Äôm a professional photographer with an established portfolio.

I‚Äôd like to increase my online presence and promote my business through digital means.

---

### Brief

Build a website that showcases the photographers work.

Interested parties should be able to get in touch.

The client should be able to add work and other interesting content.

---

# Personas & User Journeys

---

### Let's do this together

- What is this site for?
- Who are our users?
- What will they do?
- What technologies will they use?

---

# Sitemap

---

### Articulates page structure of a website

Think about:

- Hierarchy of content
- Sections and pages
- User journeys

---

### Simply a list

![Sitemap list style](day06/01designProcess/listSitemap.png)

---

### Or a flow diagram

![Sitemap flow style](day06/01designProcess/flowSitemap.png)

---

### Make a sitemap

---

# Scamping & Wireframing

---

### Articulates elements and layout

Start to think about:

- Content hierarchy on the page
- Layout + UI
- User journeys - how to get around
- Responsive behaviour

---

### No visual design

Literally just what is where & how it works

---

Crucially, a way of thinking about the content and behaviour **before visual design is considered.**

That‚Äôs why wireframes will look **bland and grey.**

We want to **focus on the function** of the site before we start thinking about style.

---

# Scamps

---

A quick sketch with a pen and paper

As your discussing the site, just sketch it out

You can throw it out and start again easily

---

![Simple scamp](day06/01designProcess/simpleScamp.png)

---

![Detailed Scamp](day06/01designProcess/detailScamp.png)

---

### Exercise:

Quickly draw out a page of the app with pen and paper.

Annotate, make notes, get thinking.

---

# Wireframes

---

### Think detail

Give to a designer to create designs from.

All elements & functionality.

Include notes and interaction.

---

### Pro tip

#### Explain what it is for

When sending a wireframe link to a client you should include an explanation of what a wireframe is for, what feedback is useful, and what isn‚Äôt

‚ÄúIt works well but I don‚Äôt like the grey‚Äù

---

### Pro tip

#### Explain what it‚Äôs for on the wireframe

Clients will circulate a wireframe link within the organisation, often without your helpful explanation of what a wireframe is for...

...so add the description to the wireframes front page!
