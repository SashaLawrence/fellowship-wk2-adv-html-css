# Bootstrap Validator

### TASK: you need to validate the form

1. To do this you need to include Boostrap form validator code - you can [find it on the cdn here](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/1000hz-bootstrap-validator) _remember to put it in the right place_
2. Once you have it included you can find the [usage instructions here](http://1000hz.github.io/bootstrap-validator/)
3. We don't need any JavaScript just HTML - once you've included the correct code you should be able to submit the form and get error messages. **Be careful you don't mistake Chrome native validation for the validator**
4. Once you have error message showing you can style them
