# Bootstrap Select

### TASK: you need to style the select element as per the design

1. To do this you will need an extra add on to Bootstrap
2. Go to [this url](https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/)
3. Read the instructions - you should include the first two dependancies:
  - Latest compiled and minified CSS
  - Latest compiled and minified JavaScript
  - **Be sure to add them into the correct part of your HTML page**
4. Read the **Usage** section - we are just working with HTML so this is all we need
5. Once everything is working you should be able to reload your HTML page, inspect your select element and see the HTML has changed.

If you have followed all the above instructions correctly you should now be able to style the new HTML elements as per the design
