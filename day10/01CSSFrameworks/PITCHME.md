# CSS Frameworks

---

### Frameworks, libraries, APIs

A library is a collection of functions / objects that serves one particular purpose. you could use a library in a variety of projects.

A framework is a collection of patterns and libraries to help with building an application.

An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your program without having direct access.

---

To put it another way, think of a library as an add-on / piece of an application , a framework as the skeleton of the application, and an API as an outward-facing part of said app.
